what makes neural networks so powerful is the addition of non-linear layers.  Take this function as an example - here, we're still multiplying a set of weights (now called beta) by our pixel values - but now, instead of the output being that raw value, we're now taking the maximum of either 0 or that output.  Additionally, we have introduced a new parameter - being represented by W alpha - and a hidden layer of intermediary nodes called h.  Let's walk through what's going on here.

First, we're taking in our 3,072 pixels, and passing them to a new type of layer - a hidden layer.  Hidden layers are poorly named, but represent intermediary layers of neural networks.  In this example, I have chosen 50 for the number of hidden layers.  That means that weights vector W beta would contain 50 * 3072 weights, or just about 154,000 weights.

In the second part of this network, we will reduce h (which is 50 outputs) down to the final 10 scores - one for each of our 10 CIFAR classes.  Here, we're going to multiply the 50 h outputs by 10 sets of weights W alpha.  The means weights vector W alpha would contain 500 total weights.

Just like in our smaller examples, the 10 scores for a given image would then be passed into a loss function, and we would then back-propogate through the network, calculating the gradient for every W, and updating accordingly.

So, why is this intermediary of h, and the additional weights, so important?  Let's go back to the CIFAR example of a horse.  You'll remember back a few lectures, if we just have one layer of weights (i.e., a linear model), the weight values for a horse end up looking something like this - i.e., images that look more like this will be classified as a horse.  In the linear case, this one single image is the image that defines a "horse".  Images that look more like this will be classified as a horse - which means that images with green grass are going to get a much higher probability.

Thus, linear models - or single layer neural networks - would suffer when trying to classify a horse that looks like this, as there is no green background.

Further, you can tell that some horses were facing left, and some right.  Thus, a linear model using CIFAR would assign a very, very high probability to a horse that looked something like...

This lovable horse here.  Obviously, that's not desirable!
