Welcome to assignment 2 for DATA 442.  This assignment is designed to closely follow the lecture; the concepts you learn in lecture will be implemented here. 

Specific topics you will master as a part of this assignment include:
1) Basic implementation of neural network architectures.
2) Vectorized backpropogation
3) Normalization & Weights Initialization for deep network training
4) Basic implementations of convolutional approaches
5) Some basics of tensorflow
5) Designing and optimizing your own net

As with assignment 1, it is highly recommended you submit your "submission.py" to gradescope regularly; you can resubmit as many times as you would like up until the due date.  Make sure you test your solution in your local environment before uploading; it can take 5-10 minutes for the online code to process your results, and the error messages may or may not be helpful!
