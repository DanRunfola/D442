					<p>Please note the below may change throughout the course.  Any changes will be announced on Piazza. All assignments and assignment materials can be found below. You must upload your modified submission.py to Gradescope (www.gradescope.com) before 11:59PM on the date an assignment is due.  No late submissions are accepted.</p>
					<p><b style="color:red">The first time you sign up for <a href="https://www.gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>, you will need an entry code to access this course.  For Spring 2021, the code is MZ2R7Y</b>. Please make sure to sign up for Gradescope using your William & Mary credentials; otherwise, I may be unable to link your name back to W&M systems.</p>
					<p>Most lab files are provided in .tar.gz format.  If you are unfamiliar with this format, <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7zip</a> will be useful!  Once you open each lab, you will find numbered files.  Start with the file 1-README.md and work your way through.  Once you've finished all of the numbered excersizes, you should be ready to complete submission.py.</p>

Points will not be given for technical issues.  It is recommended you take the midterm at a location (i.e., the library) with multiple computers you can access.  It is up to you to ensure you have a ’plan B’ in case of technical issues with your computer.  The midterm must be taken independently (i.e., no groups), but you can use any notes or other resources you would like.  The midterm covers materials up to and including this week - make sure you watch lecture 7 before starting!</td>
