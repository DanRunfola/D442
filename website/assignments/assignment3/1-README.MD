Welcome to assignment 3 for DATA 442.  This assignment is designed to closely follow the lecture; the concepts you learn in lecture will be implemented here. 

Specific topics you will master as a part of this assignment include:
1) Using keras to construct neural networks, including data loading
2) Basic tools for debugging, visualizing and understanding network performance
3) How to implement variable learning rates, image augmentation, and transfer learning approaches
4) Basic implementations of RNNs
5) Basic implementations of generative models

As with assignments 1 and 2, it is highly recommended you submit to gradescope regularly; you can resubmit as many times as you would like up until the due date.  Note that in this assignment, you will be conducting the majority of model fits on your local machine, and then uploading your solved networks.
